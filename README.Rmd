This is a package of functions that we have developed and found useful in our professional and personal work. Please feel free to use and expand upon it to make your life easier.

## Installation

## Current Functions

### Sensitivity Table
This function senerate a sensitivity table given a two input formula. For example, to generate a sensitivity table for monthly mortgage payments of a 30 year mortgage based on the principle and interest rate, you could do the following:

```r
# Load the library
library(grabbag)

# Define a function to calculate the monthly payment.
pmt <- function(prinical, rate) {
  prinical * (rate/12)/(1-(1+rate/12)^-360)
}

# Generate a DT table.
GenerateSensitivityTable(pmt, 340000, .06, 10000, .0025)

# Or, a matrix if you want to use a custom format.
GenerateSensitivityTable(pmt, 340000, .06, 10000, .0025, 5, 5, 0, 'number', FALSE)


```
